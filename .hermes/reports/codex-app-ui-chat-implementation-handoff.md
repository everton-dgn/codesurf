# Codex-inspired CodeSurf implementation handoff

Generated: 2026-05-01 20:02:56 BST

Scope:
- Target repo: `/Users/jkneen/clawd/collaborator-clone`
- Reference report: `.hermes/reports/codex-app-ui-chat-reference-report.md`
- Implementation pass: controlled Codex-inspired UI/UX improvements, no feature removals.

## What changed

### 1. Layout token foundation

File: `src/renderer/src/index.css`

Added centralized CodeSurf/Codex-style CSS tokens for:
- Sidebar default/min/max width.
- Sidebar row radius and horizontal padding.
- Chat transcript content max width.
- Composer side inset/min width/control size/radius/footer gap.
- Mini chat default dimensions.

Also added shared class primitives:
- `.cs-chat-shell`
- `.cs-chat-message-stack`
- `.cs-chat-composer-wrap`
- `.cs-chat-composer-card`
- `.cs-chat-composer-primary-toolbar`
- `.cs-chat-composer-secondary-toolbar`
- `.cs-toolbar-pill-label`
- `.cs-footer-pill-label`
- `.cs-composer-path-label`
- `.cs-thread-row`
- `.cs-thread-row-active`
- `.cs-mini-chat-window`

These keep the current React implementation intact while moving the first layer of Codex-like density behavior into one place.

### 2. Chat composer polish

File: `src/renderer/src/components/ChatTile.tsx`

Changed the chat/composer shell to use the new class primitives and CSS variables:
- Transcript max width now follows `--cs-thread-content-max-width`.
- Composer width/min-width/insets now follow `--cs-chat-composer-*` tokens.
- Toolbar and footer pill labels now collapse responsively via container queries.
- Added a compact mini-window launcher button to the primary toolbar.

Kept existing provider/model/thinking/voice/send controls, tool permission flow, chat surfaces, attachments, streaming, history, and drawers intact.

### 3. Mini chat window

Files:
- `src/main/index.ts`
- `src/preload/index.ts`
- `src/renderer/src/env.d.ts`
- `src/electrobun/browser/electron-facade.ts`
- `src/renderer/src/App.tsx`
- `src/renderer/src/components/ChatTile.tsx`

Added a first-pass Codex-style mini chat window:
- Main process owns mini windows by `workspaceId:tileId` key.
- Reuses/focuses an existing mini window for the same chat instead of spawning duplicates.
- Positions beside the owner window and clamps inside the current display work area.
- Tracks owner close/minimize/restore/focus well enough for a lightweight floating companion.
- Uses a frameless always-on-top mini BrowserWindow with a custom titlebar.
- Loads the normal renderer with query params: `miniChat=1&workspaceId=...&tileId=...`.
- Renderer switches to a dedicated mini-chat shell that mounts the same `ChatTile` against the source tile state.
- Mini-chat mode is guarded so it does not persist main-window workspace tabs, change the global active workspace, force setup UI, or run canvas proximity/auto-agent logic.

This is intentionally not a one-off `window.open`; it is a main-process managed shell, matching the direction recommended in the reference pass.

### 4. Sidebar row polish

Files:
- `src/renderer/src/App.tsx`
- `src/renderer/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`
- `src/renderer/src/index.css`

Changed the default sidebar width from 280 to 300 and gave session rows Codex-like active/hover rail treatment through the new `.cs-thread-row` classes.

The existing archive, pin, unread, title generation, open-in-chat, open-in-app, and project grouping logic is preserved.

### 5. Sidebar mini-window affordance

Files:
- `src/renderer/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`
- `src/renderer/src/components/sidebar/session-actions.ts`
- `test/sidebar/session-actions.test.mjs`

Added the next Codex-inspired mini-window burst after dogfooding confirmed the chat toolbar mini window worked well:
- Clicking any sidebar session now promotes the thread immediately in UI memory before opening, matching Codex/Cursor thread-list behavior without mutating persisted `updatedAt`.
- Tile-backed session rows now show a hover action for `Open mini window`.
- Tile-backed session context menus now include `Open Mini Window`.
- The mini affordance calls the existing `window.electron.window.openMiniChat({ workspaceId, tileId, title })` IPC path, so it reuses the main-process owned mini-window manager instead of creating another popup path.
- Row action width accounting was updated so the mini button does not collide with checkpoint or archive actions.
- Added/updated tests for the wider row-action rail.

Intentional constraint: sidebar mini-window opening is currently limited to sessions that already have a concrete `tileId`. That keeps the pass safe and avoids silently creating layout tiles for historical/external sessions just to pop them out. A future burst can add a deliberate "open into chat, then pop out" path if desired.

### 6. Composer controls extraction

Files:
- `src/renderer/src/components/ChatTile.tsx`
- `src/renderer/src/components/chat/ChatComposerControls.tsx`

Started the behavior-preserving `ChatTile` breakup with the lowest-risk composer seam:
- Moved `ToolbarBtn`, `ToolbarPill`, and `FooterPill` out of the ~9k-line `ChatTile.tsx` file.
- Kept the public JSX usage and props unchanged.
- Preserved the Codex-style CSS class hooks on toolbar/footer pill labels.
- Removed now-unused toolbar text/chevron constants and the no-longer-needed `Lock` icon import from `ChatTile.tsx`.

This is intentionally not a composer redesign yet. It is the first safe extraction layer so the prompt area, menus, drawer controls, and footer can be split in later small commits without changing behavior.

### 7. Composer menu/dropdown extraction

Files:
- `src/renderer/src/components/ChatTile.tsx`
- `src/renderer/src/components/chat/ChatComposerMenus.tsx`

Continued the behavior-preserving `ChatTile` breakup by moving menu/dropdown primitives into a dedicated file:
- Moved `MenuPortal`, `Dropdown`, `DropdownItem`, and `ModelDropdown` out of `ChatTile.tsx`.
- Kept existing JSX call sites in `ChatTile.tsx` intact by importing the extracted components.
- Preserved menu portal positioning, click/mousedown propagation stops, model filtering, active/hover states, and selection handlers.
- Kept menu typography on the same app font context as the extracted toolbar/footer controls via `useAppFonts()`; this also avoids relying on chat-root CSS variable inheritance for portaled menu DOM.

This remains a refactor-only step. Prompt/drawer behavior was not redesigned.

### 8. Composer insert menu extraction

Files:
- `src/renderer/src/components/ChatTile.tsx`
- `src/renderer/src/components/chat/ChatComposerMenus.tsx`

Moved the `+` insert menu into the same composer menu module:
- Moved `ComposerInsertMenu` and its local `MCPIcon` out of `ChatTile.tsx`.
- Moved the `ChatSurfaceMenuEntry` type into `ChatComposerMenus.tsx` and imported it back into `ChatTile.tsx`.
- Kept the existing attachment action, MCP enable/disable action, per-server enable/disable list, peer-tool read-only rows, chat-surface rows, hover styling, and submenu open/close behavior intact.
- Passed `renderChatSurfaceIcon` into the extracted component so the broader chat-surface icon mapping stays centralized in `ChatTile.tsx` and the menu extraction does not drag unrelated icon logic with it.
- Removed now-unused `Paperclip` and `MCPServerEntry` imports from `ChatTile.tsx`.

This is still a foundation/refactor burst, not a UX redesign.

### 9. Composer shell extraction

Files:
- `src/renderer/src/components/ChatTile.tsx`
- `src/renderer/src/components/chat/ChatComposer.tsx`

Moved the presentational composer frame into a dedicated module:
- Added `ChatComposerWrap`, `ChatComposerCard`, `ChatComposerPrimaryToolbar`, and `ChatComposerSecondaryToolbar`.
- Preserved the existing DOM class hooks: `.cs-chat-composer-wrap`, `.cs-chat-composer-card`, `.cs-chat-composer-primary-toolbar`, and `.cs-chat-composer-secondary-toolbar`.
- Preserved inline layout styles, child order, JSX nesting, menu refs, textarea handlers, attachment/chat-surface slots, and footer/action controls.
- Kept state ownership in `ChatTile.tsx`; this was a shell/frame extraction only, not a prompt behavior redesign.

The next safe extraction point is to move one content section at a time, starting with the autocomplete/draft-status surfaces or attachment strip, rather than passing the entire composer state into one giant new component.

### 10. Composer attachment strip extraction

Files:
- `src/renderer/src/components/ChatTile.tsx`
- `src/renderer/src/components/chat/ChatComposer.tsx`

Moved the attachment preview strip into the composer module:
- Added `ChatComposerAttachment` and `ChatComposerAttachments`.
- Preserved image/file preview layout, basename display, remove button behavior, theme colors, and exact monospace font selection by passing `fontMono` from `ChatTile.tsx`.
- Kept attachment state and `removeAttachment` ownership in `ChatTile.tsx`; the extracted component is presentational plus one callback.
- Left message-render attachment UI in `ChatTile.tsx` untouched; this extraction is only for pending composer attachments.

The next safe extraction point is likely the autocomplete popup or dictation/TTS composer banners.

### 11. Composer voice status extraction

Files:
- `src/renderer/src/components/ChatTile.tsx`
- `src/renderer/src/components/chat/ChatComposer.tsx`

Moved the dictation/TTS status banners into the composer module:
- Added `ChatComposerVoiceStatus`.
- Preserved the dictation recording indicator, dictation error rendering, interim transcript text, TTS speaking indicator, queued-count label, and stop button behavior.
- Kept voice/VAD/TTS state ownership in `ChatTile.tsx`; the extracted component receives state and an `onStopVoicePlayback` callback.
- Kept per-message TTS playback controls in message rendering untouched; this extraction is only for composer-level status banners.

The next safe extraction point is likely the autocomplete popup or chat-surface host strip.

### 12. Composer autocomplete extraction

Files:
- `src/renderer/src/components/ChatTile.tsx`
- `src/renderer/src/components/chat/ChatComposer.tsx`

Moved the `/` and `@` autocomplete popup into the composer module:
- Added `ChatComposerAutocompleteItem` and `ChatComposerAutocompletePopup`.
- Preserved the mention helper text, active-row highlighting, hover selection, mouse-down selection, popup ref wiring, and item value/description typography.
- Kept autocomplete state, filtering, keyboard navigation, text replacement, connected-file attachment behavior, and textarea focus/cursor restoration in `ChatTile.tsx`.
- Removed now-unused local dropdown color aliases from `ChatTile.tsx`; extracted popup reads the same theme values directly.

The next safe extraction point is likely the chat-surface host strip.

### 13. Composer chat-surface host extraction

Files:
- `src/renderer/src/components/ChatTile.tsx`
- `src/renderer/src/components/chat/ChatComposer.tsx`

Moved the chat-surface tab/iframe host strip above the composer textarea into the composer module:
- Added `ChatComposerSurface` and `ChatComposerSurfaceHost`.
- Preserved surface tab rendering, active tab styling, close buttons, iframe refs, iframe sandbox attributes, active-surface visibility, and `Enhance → Builder` affordance.
- Kept chat-surface state, active-surface selection, surface opening/closing, iframe ref ownership, RPC/message handling, peer context/actions, payload flushing, and `renderChatSurfaceIcon` ownership in `ChatTile.tsx`.
- Removed the now-unused local `dropdownBorder` alias from `ChatTile.tsx`; the extracted host reads the same theme value directly.

The next safe extraction point is likely the remaining composer footer/drawer control grouping, after a focused live dogfood pass of surfaces/menus/autocomplete.

### 14. Composer project path control extraction

Files:
- `src/renderer/src/components/ChatTile.tsx`
- `src/renderer/src/components/chat/ChatComposer.tsx`

Moved the footer project path / switch-folder button into the composer module:
- Added `ChatComposerProjectPathButton`.
- Preserved the folder icon, path label, `.cs-composer-path-label` class hook, disabled cloud-state behavior, hover color behavior, title text, and click target styling.
- Kept the actual switch-folder behavior in `ChatTile.tsx` via `handleProjectFolderSwitch`, including folder picker, workspace project-folder registration, assistant status message append, and warning logs.
- Removed the now-unused `Folder` icon import from `ChatTile.tsx`; the icon now lives with the extracted project-path control.

The next safe extraction point is likely one of the remaining footer clusters: location menu, branch menu, mode chip, or context usage dial.

### 15. Composer context usage dial extraction

Files:
- `src/renderer/src/components/ChatTile.tsx`
- `src/renderer/src/components/chat/ChatComposer.tsx`

Moved the footer context-window dial and popup into the composer module:
- Added `ChatComposerContextUsageDial`.
- Preserved the 28×28 hit-box, 18×18 conic-gradient dial, inner dot, portal anchoring, context percentage/tokens copy, system-overhead note, compacting note, typography, and theme styling.
- Kept the context menu ref and menu-open state in `ChatTile.tsx`, so outside-click/Escape handling still uses the same shared menu ref array.
- Passed `NON_SELECTABLE_UI_STYLE` into the extracted component to avoid moving the broader chat UI constant.
- Fixed the extracted ref prop as `React.RefObject<HTMLDivElement | null>` after independent review caught React 19 ref nullability.

The next safe extraction point is likely one of the remaining footer clusters: location menu, branch menu, or mode chip.

### 16. Composer location menu extraction

Files:
- `src/renderer/src/components/ChatTile.tsx`
- `src/renderer/src/components/chat/ChatComposer.tsx`

Moved the footer local/cloud execution-target menu into the composer module:
- Added `ChatComposerLocationMenu`.
- Moved the local/cloud project SVG icons with the extracted visual component.
- Preserved the footer pill, `Continue in` header, local row, cloud row, remote-daemon section, active states, remote host URL sublabels, rate-limits placeholder, portal anchoring, and theme styling.
- Kept execution-target state and cloud-host mutation in `ChatTile.tsx` via explicit callbacks, so the extracted component stays presentational.
- Kept `locationMenuRef` owned by `ChatTile.tsx`, so shared outside-click/Escape handling still uses the same `menuRefs` array.

The next safe extraction point is likely the remaining footer mode chip.

### 17. Composer branch menu extraction

Files:
- `src/renderer/src/components/ChatTile.tsx`
- `src/renderer/src/components/chat/ChatComposer.tsx`

Moved the footer git branch menu into the composer module:
- Added `ChatComposerBranch` and `ChatComposerBranchMenu`.
- Moved the branch SVG icon with the extracted visual component.
- Preserved the footer pill, current-branch/project fallback label, branch search input, Enter-to-create behavior, repository path header, branches section, current-branch active state, uncommitted-file sublabel, no-git/no-match empty states, create-and-checkout button, portal anchoring, hover styling, and theme styling.
- Kept git state, branch filtering, branch creation, branch checkout, refresh behavior, and `branchMenuRef` ownership in `ChatTile.tsx`, so shared outside-click/Escape handling still uses the same `menuRefs` array.

The footer extraction pass is now effectively complete; the next safe step is live dogfooding before starting prompt/drawer UX polish.

### 18. Composer mode menu extraction

Files:
- `src/renderer/src/components/ChatTile.tsx`
- `src/renderer/src/components/chat/ChatComposer.tsx`

Moved the footer mode chip/menu into the composer module:
- Added `ChatComposerModeOption` and `ChatComposerModeMenu`.
- Moved the visual footer pill + mode dropdown rendering into `ChatComposer.tsx`.
- Preserved the ShieldCheck icon, mode label/color, active menu state, dropdown rows, row sublabels, active-mode highlighting, portal anchoring, and selection/close behavior.
- Kept mode state, `modeMenuRef`, `toggleMenu('mode')`, and `setMode(...)` ownership in `ChatTile.tsx`, so shared outside-click/Escape handling still uses the same `menuRefs` array.

This completes the low-risk footer-cluster extraction sequence: project path, context dial, location menu, branch menu, and mode menu are now all out of `ChatTile.tsx` while their state/refs remain owned by `ChatTile.tsx`.

## Verification

Commands run from `/Users/jkneen/clawd/collaborator-clone` after the latest composer mode menu extraction:

```bash
npm run build
npm test
git diff --check
git diff --cached --check
```

Results:
- `npm run build`: passed.
- `npm test`: passed, 177 tests, 0 failures.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- `git diff --cached --check`: passed before committing the code extraction.
- Static scan of added lines for common secret/injection patterns: no findings.
- Independent review: passed; no security concerns or logic errors for the `ChatComposerModeMenu` extraction.

## Recommended next burst

1. Dogfood the extracted attachment/shell/menu/voice/autocomplete/chat-surface host/project-path/context-dial/location-menu/branch-menu/mode-menu path in the running app: type `/`, type `@`, use arrow keys/Enter/Escape, click autocomplete rows, attach/remove files, open the `+` menu, toggle MCP, open a chat surface, switch/close surface tabs, verify `Enhance → Builder`, switch project folder from the footer path button, open the context dial popup, switch local/cloud/remote execution target from the location menu, use provider/model/thinking/branch/mode menus, trigger dictation/TTS banners, and send/stop a message.
2. Start actual Codex-inspired prompt/drawer UX polish now that the low-risk composer/footer extraction seams are stable: denser command surface, clearer collapse/expand behavior, compact advanced controls, and no feature removals.
3. Add a deliberate "open historical/external session into chat, then pop out" flow only if the sidebar mini action should work for sessions with no `tileId`.
4. Start the Git Review extension/diff virtualization pass from the reference report as a separate burst.
