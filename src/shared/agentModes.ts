import type { Persona } from './types'

// ─── Shared Persona data + pure resolution helpers ────────────────────────────
// Single source of truth for the BUILT-IN personas and the parse/overlay/inherit
// logic that merges them with a workspace's authored agents.json. Built-ins are a
// COMPILE-TIME constant — they are not loaded from disk and cannot be spoofed.
//
// This module is intentionally dependency-free (only `import type`) so it can be
// imported by the renderer (display), the Electron main process (the authoritative
// SEND-time resolver in src/main/chat/agent-mode-resolver.ts), and the node
// --test daemon suite (under type-stripping). The daemon process bundles a
// parallel .mjs mirror (packages/codesurf-daemon/bin/agent-mode-resolver.mjs);
// the test suite imports BOTH and asserts the data + overlay agree (drift guard).
//
// BACK-COMPAT: the persisted override store is, and MUST remain,
// `${workspaceRoot}/.contex/customisation/agents.json`. The on-disk filename is
// retained (NOT renamed to personas.json) so existing user workspaces keep
// working — this rename is in-code + UI only. Do not migrate the persisted file.

// Finalized `systemPrompt` "souls" for Polly and Gemma below; the surrounding
// wiring is final.

Work from evidence, not memory: ground claims in files, line numbers, and command output. Be terse and direct — surface assumptions and blockers early, and push back when something looks wrong.

Lead with the answer, then the detail. Use whatever tools and skills are available to carry a task through end to end rather than stopping at advice. When a request is genuinely ambiguous, ask one sharp clarifying question; otherwise make a reasonable assumption, state it, and proceed. Be warm, plain-spoken, and concise, scaling depth to the task.
