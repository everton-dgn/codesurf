# Code Index — Target Pivot

**Date:** 2026-05-03
**Why this doc exists:** the original spec and plan targeted the wrong product. This doc captures the corrected target, what survives the pivot, what dies, and the long-term architecture the design must accommodate.

---

## The mistake

The spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-03-code-index-design.md` and the plan at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-03-code-index.md` were written for the **CodeSurf desktop app** (`collaborator-clone`, the Electron host). Five tasks were implemented in that worktree before the user caught it.

The intended target is the **CodeSurf CLI**, which is the project at:

    /Users/jkneen/Documents/GitHub/grok-cli/

`grok-cli` is being rebranded to `codesurf`. They are the same product — `grok-cli` is the codename, `codesurf` is the public name. The binary `/usr/local/bin/codesurf` is a symlink to `grok-cli/scripts/codesurf.sh`.

---

## Long-term architecture (must inform design choices)

The user's statement, captured verbatim so the next session does not lose it:

> "eventually this will merge with the daemon in codesurf so they will be one and the same then the desktop app will use this as it's daemon and cli too"

Decoded:

1. **Now:** `grok-cli` (CLI/TUI) and the CodeSurf desktop app (`collaborator-clone`, Electron) are two separate codebases.
2. **Soon:** `grok-cli` absorbs the CodeSurf daemon role. They become one repo / one runtime.
3. **Eventually:** the desktop app stops being a standalone agent and becomes a **UI shell** that talks to the merged `grok-cli` (the daemon) — both for CLI invocations and for the desktop tile/panel UI.

Implications for code-index:

- **Build it in `grok-cli`.** That is where it will live forever.
- **Keep `lib/*` as platform-agnostic Node modules** so they survive any process boundary the merge introduces. They already are.
- **Expose the index via clean interfaces** (in-process function calls + MCP server) so the future desktop UI can consume the same data without re-implementation.
- **Do NOT design for the desktop app's tile bridge.** That layer goes away or gets reshaped when the merge happens.
- **Hook integration goes through `grok-cli/src/hooks/`** — the in-process hook system grok-cli already has.

YAGNI guard: do not pre-build for the merge. Design clean interfaces, ship for the CLI, let the merge happen when it happens.

---

## What survives the pivot (reuse intact)

Five tasks were committed on `feat/code-index` in this worktree (`/Users/jkneen/clawd/collaborator-clone-code-index/`). Every commit hash is in `HANDOFF-2026-05-03-code-index.md`. The reusable artefacts:

| File | Reusable? | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| `lib/storage.js` | **Yes, as-is** | Atomic JSON write, debounced, JSONL append + rotation. Pure Node. Drop-in for `grok-cli/src/code-index/lib/storage.ts` (port to TS). |
| `lib/indexer.js` | **Yes, as-is** | Counters, hotness with decay, co-occurrence with session windows. Pure logic. Port to TS. |
| `lib/workspace.js` | **Yes, as-is** | `cwd → workspace root` resolution with `.git` walk + env override. |
| `lib/ingest-server.js` | **Probably drop** | HTTP localhost ingest. Not needed when hooks run in-process inside grok-cli. Keep the file in case the future desktop merge wants an HTTP endpoint, but do not wire it in for the CLI MVP. |
| `evals/unit/*.test.mjs` | **Yes, port** | Test bodies survive; convert to vitest TS in grok-cli's existing test setup. |
| `vitest.config.mjs` | **Drop** | grok-cli has its own. |
| `extension.json` | **Drop** | CodeSurf-desktop manifest. Irrelevant for CLI. |
| `package.json` | **Drop** | grok-cli has its own deps. |

**~600 LOC of working, tested code carries over.** The ~hour spent on `extension.json` scaffolding, the desktop-extension review loop, and the desktop tile design (Task 7.1 in the plan) are the actual loss.

## What dies

- **Tiles.** No tiles in a CLI. If observability is needed, ship a `codesurf code-index status` subcommand or a `--json` MCP tool response that pretty-prints in the terminal.
- **`extension.json`.** No CodeSurf-desktop manifest. grok-cli does not load extensions this way.
- **`main.js` shape.** The current main.js was written around `ctx.bus`, `ctx.mcp.registerTool`, `ctx.workspacePath`. None of that exists in grok-cli. The new entrypoint is a stdio MCP server.
- **Hook config snippet for Claude Code's `settings.json`.** Wrong tool. The new hook config goes in grok-cli's hook config format (see `grok-cli/src/hooks/config.ts` and `types.ts`).
- **Plan tasks 4.2 (main.js wiring around ctx) and 7.1 (dashboard tile).** Replace with grok-cli-shaped equivalents.

## What stays valid conceptually

The spec's design decisions are target-agnostic. These all carry forward:

- 3 query MCP tools + 2 admin tools (`find`, `hot`, `related`, `backfill`, `stats`).
- Hotness formula: `Σ weight × exp(-age_days / 14)` with `read=1, edit=3, write=5`.
- Co-occurrence: 30-min sliding session window, dedup pairs per session.
- Per-workspace storage, keyed by sha1(workspace-root).
- Companion skill at `~/.claude/skills/code-index/`.
- Eval suite shape: unit (gates CI) + agent-loop (nightly) + replay harness.
- Privacy stance: paths + symbol names + counters only, never file contents.

## What the resuming session should do (in order)

1. **Read this doc.** All of it.
2. **Read `HANDOFF-2026-05-03-code-index.md`** for the existing-work snapshot.
3. **Confirm with user** they still want option 1 (salvage + relocate into `grok-cli/src/code-index/`) before doing anything destructive. Mention options 2 (native built-in tool in `src/tools/`) and 3 (standalone MCP package) for completeness.
4. **Open `grok-cli`** (`/Users/jkneen/Documents/GitHub/grok-cli/`).
5. **Read its conventions:**
   - `AGENTS.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
   - `src/hooks/{config,executor,index,types}.ts` — hook system
   - `src/mcp/{catalog,runtime,validate}.ts` — MCP server runtime
   - `src/tools/*.ts` — built-in tool patterns
   - Existing `docs/superpowers/specs/` and `plans/` — house style
   - Test setup (`vitest.config.ts`)
6. **Write a corrected spec** at `grok-cli/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-03-code-index-design.md`. Reuse the design decisions table from the original spec. Replace the architecture section with the grok-cli-native one.
7. **Write a corrected plan** at `grok-cli/docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-03-code-index.md`. Drop the desktop-specific tasks. Add tasks for: porting lib/* to TS, MCP server entrypoint, in-process hook handler, integration with grok-cli's MCP catalog.
8. **Get spec + plan approval** from the user before resuming code work.
9. **Port `lib/storage.js`, `lib/indexer.js`, `lib/workspace.js`** as the first three implementation tasks. The original tests transfer almost verbatim.
10. **Continue from there.**

## Salvage commands

When ready to copy the reusable lib over (do this AFTER the new spec + plan are approved):

```bash
# From this worktree:
cp /Users/jkneen/clawd/collaborator-clone-code-index/examples/extensions/code-index/lib/storage.js \
   /Users/jkneen/Documents/GitHub/grok-cli/src/code-index/storage.ts.draft

cp /Users/jkneen/clawd/collaborator-clone-code-index/examples/extensions/code-index/lib/indexer.js \
   /Users/jkneen/Documents/GitHub/grok-cli/src/code-index/indexer.ts.draft

cp /Users/jkneen/clawd/collaborator-clone-code-index/examples/extensions/code-index/lib/workspace.js \
   /Users/jkneen/Documents/GitHub/grok-cli/src/code-index/workspace.ts.draft

# Then port .js → .ts (mostly type annotations, CommonJS → ESM).
# Then port the test bodies from evals/unit/*.test.mjs into grok-cli's test setup.
```

## What to do with the desktop-extension worktree

Two options:

- **A. Leave it.** Branch `feat/code-index` stays as a record of the wrong-target attempt. No PR. Eventually delete the branch. The committed work stays available if anyone wants to reference the lib modules.
- **B. Revert.** `git push origin :feat/code-index` once the lib has been salvaged into grok-cli. Cleaner, loses the audit trail.

User decision when they get there. Default to **A** until told otherwise.

---

## TL;DR for the next session

> Wrong target. Code Index belongs in `grok-cli` (= the CodeSurf CLI), not in `collaborator-clone` (the desktop app). Future state: grok-cli will become the daemon the desktop app uses, so building in grok-cli is forward-compatible. ~600 LOC of pure Node modules salvages cleanly; the desktop-extension scaffolding (manifest, tile, bridge wiring) is throwaway. New spec + plan must be written in `grok-cli/docs/superpowers/` before any code moves.
