## 0. North star

Make CodeSurf plugins **piss-easy to write and incredibly powerful**: a plugin can
appear as a canvas view, a chat-composer surface, a footer item, a settings section,
a command/`/slash`, a layout preset, and/or an agent integration — declared as data
where possible, with a full programmatic escape hatch when needed — while **every
existing extension keeps working and gets better**, and the whole thing is consistent
and themable by default.

Three hard rules carried from the goal:
1. **No borrowed proprietary names.** Our own vocabulary throughout (§1). Third-party
   standards keep their names.
2. **Zero regression.** Today's `extension.json` + `ext:` IPC + `window.contex` bridge
   keep working byte-for-byte; v2 is additive/opt-in. The no-regression contract is
   spelled out in §13.
3. **Evolve in place.** New plugin surfaces build on CodeSurf's existing strengths
   (canvas engine, multi-provider chat + permission UX, peer/relay, daemon, MCP node
   bridge, Chrome sync/voice/generation).

---

## 1. Vocabulary (original — locked)

| Term | Meaning | Replaces / relation |
|---|---|---|
| **Plugin** | The unit of extensibility (user-facing). | Replaces user-facing "extension"; `extension.json` stays as the legacy/compat manifest. |
| **CodeSurf Plugin** | First-party / built-in capability shipped as a plugin. | The rewired built-ins (§7). |
| **Community Plugin** | Third-party installed plugin. | — |
| **Agent Plugin** | A plugin that contributes agent behaviour, tools, or a model provider. | New class (§ agent integration). |
| **`plugin.json`** | v2 manifest (superset of `extension.json`). | `extension.json` still loads. |
| **`definePlugin()`** | Typed programmatic entry from the SDK. | Industry-standard name; not proprietary. |
| **`@codesurf/plugin`** | The typed plugin SDK (host API types + `definePlugin` + `PluginContext`). | Our namespace. |
| **`@codesurf/ui`** | Default consistent component kit (fields, buttons, switches…) on the `--ct-*` tokens. | New (§8). |
| **`window.codesurf`** | Canonical bridge global. | `window.contex` kept as a permanent alias. |
| **Surface** | A place a plugin shows up: `view`, `composer`, `footer`, `panel`, `settings`, `menu`, `command`. | Generalises `chatSurfaces`. |
| **Contribution** | A declared capability in `contributes` (data) or registered at runtime (code). | Extends today's `contributes`. |
| **Slot** | Host mount point. `<Slot kind="footer"/>` + `useContributions('footer')`. | New host primitive. |
| **Command** | A named action; appears in the **Command Palette** and optionally as a `/slash`. | New. |
| **Capability** | A brokered host service a plugin requests and the user consents to (`relay`, `fs`, `network`, `shell`, `chat`, `daemon`, `chrome`, `secrets`). | Replaces the inert `permissions[]` + the hardcoded relay bridge. |
| **Plugin Store** | Per-plugin reactive, persisted, schema'd state. `ctx.store` / `usePluginState`. | Fills the "no durable store" gap. |
| **Capability Registry / Contribution Registry** | Host-side registries that collect contributions and resolve them into UI/commands/tools. | New. |
| **Render mode** | How a surface paints: `iframe` (sandboxed custom HTML), `component` (in-host React, trusted/built-in), `mcp-ui` (MCP-UI resources — the easy default). | Generalises `ui.mode`. |
| **Execution mode** | Trust/runtime of plugin logic: `iframe`, `node`, `worker`. | Orthogonal to render; replaces `safe`/`power` (kept as aliases). |
| **Plugin Dev Mode** | Run one plugin live in the real host with hot reload. | New (§ dev). |
| **Dev Sandbox** | A separate CodeSurf instance, **dashed border**, isolated user-data-dir, for testing a plugin in isolation. | New (§ dev). |
| **Plugin Studio** | The authoring experience itself, shipped as a first-party plugin (files + git + code view + live preview). | New (§ dev). |
| **Layout** | A saved arrangement of views (panel tree). Any full-screen arrangement/snap becomes one. | First-classes the existing `panelLayout`. |
| **Layout Preset** | A named, reusable layout a plugin can register/open (e.g. "Chat Workspace"). | New (§10). |

Banned tokens anywhere in our code/UI/package names: third-party competitor product
names, framework package scopes, CLI verbs, and replicated-DB names from other desktop
IDE shells. The third-party agent runtime we may depend on is published by an unrelated
author and is fine as a *dependency*, but it is surfaced in our UI under a neutral
CodeSurf label (see § agent integration).

---

## 2. The unlocking reframe — two orthogonal axes

Today `tier: 'safe' → ui.mode:'native'` and `power → custom` are conflated and the
`native` path is unimplemented. Split into two independent axes:

- **execution**: `iframe` (sandboxed, postMessage) · `node` (in-main, trusted) · `worker` (utilityProcess, isolated — stretch)
- **render**: `iframe` (custom HTML in sandbox) · `component` (in-host React) · `mcp-ui` (MCP-UI resource, themed by us)

Back-compat aliases (absent v2 fields ⇒ derive from v1):
- `tier:'safe'` ⇒ `execution:'iframe'`
- `tier:'power'` ⇒ `execution:'node'`
- `ui.mode:'custom'`/absent ⇒ `render:'iframe'`
- `ui.mode:'native'` ⇒ `render:'mcp-ui'` (now real) for v2 plugins; v1 stays iframe.

This makes `{node, component}` (trusted in-bundle view) and `{iframe, mcp-ui}` (easy
themed UI in a sandbox) first-class — both impossible today.

---

## 3. Manifest superset (`plugin.json` ⊇ `extension.json`)

All v2 fields are **optional**; a manifest with none behaves exactly as today. (TS
types land in `src/shared/types.ts` — see Phase 0.)

```jsonc
{
  "id": "git",
  "name": "Git",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "manifestVersion": 2,            // absent ⇒ legacy v1 path
  "kind": "codesurf",             // codesurf | community | agent
  "engines": { "codesurf": ">=0.1.0" },
  "execution": "node",            // iframe | node | worker  (alias: tier)
  "render": "component",          // iframe | component | mcp-ui  (alias: ui.mode)
  "capabilities": [               // consented at enable time; replaces inert permissions[]
    { "name": "fs", "reason": "read repo status" },
    { "name": "shell", "reason": "run git" }
  ],
  "dependsOn": ["code-index"],    // load order + typed access (codegen later)
  "contributes": {
    // v1 (unchanged): tiles, chatSurfaces, mcpTools, contextMenu, settings, actions, context
    "commands": [
      { "id": "git.commit", "title": "Git: Commit", "slash": "commit", "keybinding": "mod+k c", "run": { "method": "commit" } }
    ],
    "footer":         [ { "id": "git.status", "entry": "footer.html", "render": "mcp-ui", "position": "left" } ],
    "panels":         [ { "id": "git.tree", "title": "Source Control", "entry": "panel.html", "region": "right" } ],
    "settingsSections":[ { "id": "git", "title": "Git", "items": [ /* control union */ ] } ],
    "layoutPresets":  [ { "id": "git.review", "title": "Code Review", "layout": { /* panel tree */ } } ],
    "agentExtensions":[ { "path": "agent/guardrails.js" } ]   // shapes the agent runtime
  },
  "main": "main.js",              // execution entry (node/worker)
  "permissions": ["network"]       // legacy; mapped onto capabilities
}
```

Every contribution carries an optional `render` so a plugin can mix modes (e.g. an
`mcp-ui` footer + a `component` view).

---

## 4. Contribution registry + Slots (the centerpiece)

One generic host registry, instantiated per surface kind, fed by (a) declarative
`contributes` and (b) runtime `ctx.contribute(kind, spec)`; wiped on plugin reload and
re-collected. Host code consumes it:

```tsx
// host
const footerItems = useContributions('footer')        // reactive
<Slot kind="footer" />                                 // renders all, sorted by order
```

`<Slot>` renders each contribution by its `render` mode: `component` inline in the host
tree, `iframe` through the existing `ExtensionTile`/`window.contex` path, `mcp-ui`
through the MCP-UI renderer (§8). **New view/tile types appear with zero `App.tsx`
edits** — the closed `TileType` union is retired in favour of registry lookup (built-ins
migrate incrementally; the union stays valid throughout — §7).

Surface→host-region map:
- `view` → canvas tile (+ 3 auto command-palette rows: open / replace / split)
- `composer` → chat area above the input (today's `chatSurfaces`, generalised)
- `footer` → status bar item
- `panel` → left/right/bottom region
- `settings` → a settings section
- `menu` → canvas/tile context menu
- `command` → Command Palette + optional `/slash`

### Commands, palette, shortcuts (point 3)
A single `ContributionRegistry` powers three sibling registries — **commands**
(real closures, palette overlay on the existing unused `cmdk` `command.tsx`),
**shortcuts** (register/rebind/reset, persisted, `when`-scoped), **settings**
(section/item control union). `/slash` commands route through the same command
registry from the composer. Every command is optionally agent-callable, so the human
palette and the agent share one registry.

---

## 5. Plugin Store, events, RPC, hooks

- **Plugin Store** — `ctx.store` + `usePluginState(selector)`: a per-plugin reactive
  JSON store persisted at `~/.codesurf/plugin-state/<id>.json`, optional zod schema,
  change-broadcast over the existing event bus to every renderer. Fixes the confirmed
  "Builder history not persisted" class of bug. **Decision: extend the event bus +
  this store; do NOT adopt a full replicated DB** (heavy, fights our file-based model).
- **Typed events / RPC** — typed channels layered over the existing bus; `ctx.peer(id)`
  typed RPC unifying the two current host routers.
- **Host hooks** — **named, typed extension points** (`defineHostHook` +
  `ctx.hooks.wrap/before/after`) instead of arbitrary AOP. Covers the real cases (wrap
  composer, decorate a tool-call) refactor-safely; no fragile build transform.

---

## 6. Capabilities + consent (surpass — both reference & us are weak here)

Host services register **named capabilities** with a risk level; a plugin declares the
ones it wants; the user **consents at enable/install time**; the broker returns a
**scoped handle** with no ambient access. The relay 14-method surface becomes the
broker's first consumer (retiring the hardcoded `id === 'contex-relay-suite'`
special-case). `node` execution flows through the broker rather than raw `require()`
into main. A `worker`/utilityProcess tier (true isolation) is the stretch. This gives
the today-inert `permissions[]` real teeth — explicit user consent at install/enable
time.

---

## 7. Built-ins as plugins (point 7)

Built-ins become **CodeSurf Plugins** (`kind:'codesurf'`, `execution:'node'` where
needed, `render:'component'`) registered through the same contribution registry —
**migrated one at a time**. The `TileType` union and the `App.tsx` render switch stay
valid throughout; each built-in flips to a self-registering `component` contribution
behind a no-regression check. No big-bang. End state: "add a new tile type" is as easy
for a built-in as for a community plugin.

---

## 8. UI consistency + MCP-UI (points 8 & 9)

- **`@codesurf/ui`** — a default component kit (Field, Button, Switch, Select, Input,
  Tabs, etc.) styled on the existing `--ct-*` tokens + `data-ct-mode`. Plugins get
  consistent, themed controls **for free**; override only to customise. This is how
  "I can put together UIs easily" holds across plugins.
- **MCP-UI as the default UI substrate** — adopt the third-party `@mcp-ui/client`
  (`AppRenderer`/`UIResourceRenderer`) + `@mcp-ui/server` (`createUIResource`).
  `render:'mcp-ui'` lets a plugin describe UI as **MCP-UI resources** (HTML / remote-DOM
  / external URL) that the host renders in a sandboxed iframe with our theme + UI kit
  injected. This is the "piss-easy" path: declare UI as data, get a consistent themed
  result, no bundler.
  - Custom UIs (`render:'iframe'` / `'component'`) layer on top for full control.
  - **Built-ins stay `component`** with thin MCP-UI-compatible wrappers so they sit in
    the same slots as community plugins.
  - MCP-UI's tool/action callbacks bridge to our command + capability system.

---

## 9. Agent integration (the in-process coding-agent runtime)

Integrate the third-party agent runtime (published by an unrelated author — allowed as
a dependency) **in-process** as a new chat provider, **alongside** the existing five
(claude/codex/opencode/openclaw/hermes), never replacing them. Surfaced in our UI under
a **neutral CodeSurf label** (no third-party brand in the UI; provider id internal).

Wiring, streaming mitigation, and sequencing are covered in phase **P5** (§12). Key
non-negotiables: load via dynamic `import()` (zero boot cost for non-users);
suffix-delta extraction + microtask-coalesced flush (the runtime emits a full snapshot
per token); bridge our tools/peers in-process (the runtime has no MCP client); reuse our
existing tool-permission UX via its tool-call hook. Plugins shape agent behaviour via
`contributes.agentExtensions` (guardrails, custom tools) and our `Agent Plugin` class.

---

## 10. Layouts as a first-class, reusable feature (point 10)

Build on the existing `panelLayout` (PanelNode tree), `expandedTileId`,
`expandLayoutGroupId`, `expandedCanvasGroupId`, `isLayoutVariantWorkspace`, and the
`PanelLayout` component.

- **Double-click a view** → full-screen it; other views in the same arrangement are
  reachable as **tabs**.
- **Snap/arrange views together** → the arrangement **becomes a Layout** automatically
  (a named panel tree), promotable to a **Layout Preset**.
- **Layout Presets** are registerable by plugins and openable by users/agents, e.g. a
  "Chat Workspace" preset = sessions left · chat centre · git right. Opening a preset
  instantiates the named views into the panel tree.
- Presets are data (`contributes.layoutPresets`) referencing view kinds from the
  contribution registry, so any plugin's views can participate.

---

## 11. Developer experience (points 4 & 5)

- **Plugin Dev Mode** — `codesurf plugin dev <dir>` runs the plugin in the **real** host
  bridge with hot reload (kills the current drift between the static harness and the
  real `ExtensionTile` bridge — one source of truth).
- **Dev Sandbox** — launches a separate CodeSurf instance with a **dashed border** and
  an isolated `--user-data-dir`, so a plugin (or a whole workspace) is tested in a clean
  playground without touching the user's data.
- **Plugin Studio** — the authoring surface shipped *as a first-party plugin*: composes
  the file, git, and code-view plugins + a live preview Slot + a "Run in Dev / Open
  Sandbox" control. Dogfoods the whole platform.
- **SDK + CLI** — `@codesurf/plugin` (typed `definePlugin`, generated `window.codesurf`
  types) + `codesurf plugin new|dev|build|package`. Scaffold emits a working `plugin.json`
  + entry + types. Hand-written JSON+HTML plugins still work with no SDK.

---

## 12. Phased roadmap (build order)

Each phase is independently shippable and carries a **no-regression guard**. Front-loads
the additive substrate, then the centerpiece, then power, then polish.

| Phase | Goal | Key changes | No-regression guard |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P0 Foundations** | Additive substrate. | Manifest superset (v2 optional fields) in `types.ts`; execution⟂render axes + v1 aliases; **fix `ctx.settings.get`** + add `set`/`getAll`; manifest normalisation derives axes from `tier`/`ui.mode`. | All current `extension.json` load via the exact current path; bundled+example plugins run untouched; typecheck clean. |
| **P1 Capabilities** | Brokered, consented host services. | Capability registry + `ctx.use()`; consent UI in the gallery; relay = first capability (verbatim methods); map `permissions[]`→capabilities. | relay-suite keeps working via alias until it opts in. |
| **P2 Contributions + Slots + Palette + Shortcuts** | Open slot model + command palette + rebindable shortcuts + `/slash`. | `useContributions`/`<Slot>`; one registry → commands/shortcuts/settings; palette overlay on `command.tsx`; composer slash menu. | Built-ins keep `App.tsx` rendering; `TileType` union stays valid; migration opt-in. |
| **P3 Store + events + hooks** | Durable reactive state, typed comms, named hooks. | `~/.codesurf/plugin-state/<id>.json` store + `usePluginState`; typed event channels + `ctx.peer()`; `defineHostHook`. | Bus + ring buffer + tile-context preserved; existing chains flow. |
| **P4 UI kit + MCP-UI** | Consistent themed UI + the easy `mcp-ui` path. | `@codesurf/ui`; `render:'mcp-ui'` via `@mcp-ui/client`; theme+kit injection; action→command/capability bridge. | iframe + component renders unchanged; built-ins wrap compatibly. |
| **P5 Agent runtime** | In-process agent provider + agent plugins. | New provider `case` in `chat.ts` (neutral label); streaming mitigation; in-process tool/peer bridge; `agentExtensions`. | Existing 5 providers + session files untouched; non-users load nothing. |
| **P6 Layouts** | First-class reusable layouts. | Auto-layout on snap/arrange; fullscreen+tabs; `layoutPresets`; open-preset action. | Existing panel layout / groups / saved templates intact. |
| **P7 Authoring loop** | SDK + CLI + Dev Mode + Dev Sandbox + Plugin Studio. | `@codesurf/plugin` + `codesurf plugin` CLI; dev-child with dashed border + isolated data dir; Plugin Studio plugin. | Hand-written plugins + `/build-extensions` skill still work. |
| **P8 Plugins rename + built-in rewire + marketplace** | User-facing "Plugins"; built-ins as plugins; real catalog. | Gallery → "Plugins"; incremental built-in migration; remote catalog + install pipeline (download→verify→validate→place→hot-reload→consent). | Each migrated built-in passes its capability checklist; legacy ids preserved. |
| **P9 Onboarding + auto-update** | Parity, mapped to our surfaces. | Welcome/recents/project palette; per-plugin + app update over existing `electron-updater`. | Workspace mgmt + theme + agent-setup extended, not replaced. |

---

## 13. No-regression contract

Nothing in the headline capability set below may regress; each phase's guard proves it.
Headline: the canvas engine,
everything-is-a-tile, the 5 chat providers + permission UX, peer/relay, daemon/detached
jobs, MCP server + node bridge, Chrome sync/voice/generation/dreaming/local-proxy, and
the foreign-format adapters all keep working and get **better** by gaining the new slot,
store, capability, and UI systems.

---

## 14. Security — current trust posture and roadmap

### Current posture (as of this writing)

`power`/`node` extensions are loaded via `require()` directly into the Electron
**main process** and their `activate(ctx)` is called with a full `ExtensionContext`.
This grants unrestricted access to all of Node.js — `fs`, `child_process`, `net`,
arbitrary `require()`, etc.  It is equivalent to installing a native application.

The **capability system** (§6, P1) gates the **iframe bridge** only.  It does not
constrain power extensions.

**Activation gates** (the current mitigations):

| Scope | Default | Requires explicit user opt-in? |
|---|---|---|
| bundled (shipped with the app) | enabled | no |
| global (`~/.contex/extensions/`) | enabled | no |
| catalog (gallery entries) | **disabled** | yes — gallery "Add" / enable |
| workspace (`.contex/extensions/` in a cloned repo) | **disabled** | yes — explicit enable, persisted |

The workspace default-off is the critical protection: any project a user clones can
ship `.contex/extensions/` but none of those power scripts will execute unless the
user explicitly enables each one.  Opt-ins are persisted to
`~/.contex/enabled-catalog-extensions.json`.

A `[Security]` warning is emitted to the main-process log at `require()` time naming
the extension, its scope, and the full entry path.  A separate `[Security]` warning is
emitted at `enable()` time when the user opts in.

### Planned improvement — broker / utilityProcess isolation

`§6` specifies the intended end state: _"`node` execution flows through the broker
rather than raw `require()` into main"_.  The plan is a `worker`/`utilityProcess` tier
that receives a scoped capability handle (not ambient Node) and communicates with main
over a structured channel.  This would reduce a compromised power extension from
"full main process" to "the capabilities the user consented to".

This is a substantial rearchitecture tracked for a future phase.  Until it lands, the
raw `require()` path persists and the workspace/catalog default-off gates remain the
primary defence.
